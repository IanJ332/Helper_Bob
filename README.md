# Model Shard Usage Report

## Introduction

This report provides an overview of the recommended model shards for code generation tasks based on the testing results from the GPT-4 dataset and the Code20K dataset. The shards were evaluated for their ability to generate coherent and complete code snippets. Below, we highlight the best-performing shards and provide guidance on their usage based on specific needs.

## Usage Recommendations

### For Code Generation Tasks

- **General Code Generation**: Use any of the recommended shards for reliable and accurate code generation. They all provide complete code snippets, but specific shards may offer more detailed comments and explanations.
- **Documentation and Comments**: If your primary goal is to generate code with detailed comments and documentation, prefer **`model-00004-of-00009.safetensors`** and **`model-00007-of-00009.safetensors`**. These shards have shown strong capabilities in providing well-documented code.

### For Specific Requirements

- **Basic Functionality**: If you only need the core functionality of code without extensive comments, **`model-00009-of-00009.safetensors`** is highly recommended.
- **Detailed Explanations**: For generating code with comprehensive explanations and detailed comments, **`model-00004-of-00009.safetensors`** and **`model-00007-of-00009.safetensors`** are preferable.
